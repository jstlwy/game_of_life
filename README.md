# Conway's Game of Life
An extremely naive implementation of Conway's Game of Life
that I was inspired to make while reading Michael Abash's
["Graphics Programming Black Book"](https://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919).

## Requirements
* macOS or Linux
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)
